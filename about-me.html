        <h4><u>About Me</u></h4>
        <p>Hi! I’m a Talent Management professional with an interest in recruiting, hiring, developing, and retaining the most effective employees possible. I focus on creating unique strategies and execution plans that will improve business value. I have worked on many strategic workforce projects related to recruitment, interviewing, new hire processes, retention, coaching, goal setting, leadership development, marketing, and career planning.</p>
        <p>Although I've loved working in HR, I miss having technical projects to work on. I have decided I want to pivot my career into the user experience space which is why I enrolled in this class. I am really excited to learn the basics of front-end development!</p>
        <p>When I’m not on the job, I love to go to trivia nights, learn a new skill, and catch up with my friends and family!</p>
        <p>My favorite hobbies include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Traveling! I travel a lot for work and for fun. A few new destinations I visited in 2018 include Charleston, Austin, Madrid, and Dublin!</li>
          <li>I love to cook! I am currently trying to master my family's Trinidadian recipes.</li>
          <li>I love museums. I worked at the National Air & Space museum in DC for several years and have volunteered for a year at the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I am very excited to complete this certificate program in order to gain skills that could prepare me for a career in:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>User Experience Design</li>
          <li>Front-End Development</li>
          <li>Customer Experience Design</li>

        <h3>Article of the week: Semantic Elements</h3>
        <p>Why are semantic elements important? Semantic elements help make the website that you are building more usable and accessible. It helps your code communicate with the web browser. The definition of semantic (according to Webster) is “of or relating to meaning in language”.  Semantic elements are HTML tags that make the code more readable to the developer. Because these tags are standard anyone can go into your code and understand it. Semantic elements focus more on meaning than style. For example, if you want a sentence bolded you would not use &lt;b&gt;, but instead &lt;strong&gt; since the developer wants the word to be more emphasized and strong correlates to meaning more than bold.</p>
